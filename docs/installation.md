# Installation

## Stable release

To install Django Codemod, run this command in your terminal:

```shell
$ pip install django-codemod
```

This is the preferred method to install Django Codemod, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) installed, this [Python installation guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/) can guide you through the process.

## From sources

The sources for Django Codemod can be downloaded from the [Github repo](https://github.com/browniebroke/django-codemod).

You can either clone the public repository:

```shell
$ git clone git://github.com/browniebroke/django-codemod
```

Or download the [tarball](https://github.com/browniebroke/django-codemod/tarball/main):

```shell
$ curl -OJL https://github.com/browniebroke/django-codemod/tarball/main
```

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:
